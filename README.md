# 2. Project Intro
"Stolen Goods" is a fun parody project simulating an international e-commerce that sells items from criminals to collectors around the world. Even though this is only a parody, this web application has a fully functioning features like any other e-commerce platform.

# 3. MVT Software Pattern
Django is a free, open-source, and high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean pragmatic design and follows the MTV (Model - Template - View) software architectural patterns. Django consists of an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that connects data models defined as Python classes and the database, a system to process HTTP requests with a web templating system, and a RegEx-based URL dispatcher.

![alt MVT Software](docs/MVT-Software-Pattern.png)

# 4. Django ORM
Django uses Object-Relational Mapper that can be connected to any database. This project uses SQLite3 during the development stage for its simple fungtionality purpose and PostgreSQL for its scalability in production. PostgreSQL is used both in localhost with DataGrip and online with AWS RDS. This project has 11 relational database tables excluding the default django classes (i.e. auth_permission, auth_group, etc.).

# 5. Project Objective
* The main objective of this project is to implement the knowledge in web development and software engineering gained in spring semester 2021 by programming a fully-functional software that runs a web application.

* My private goal is to prove the superiority of Python over other programming languages by creating a web application only with a Python Web Framework: Django.

# 6. Project Setup
* Clone / Download the repository

* Make sure you have python 8.x or higher, othwerwise [Upgrade Your Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or run "brew upgrade python" on your terminal

* Create a virtual env "python -m venv <YOUR_VENV_NAME>" or "mkvirtualenv <YOUR_VENV_NAME>"

* Activate virtualenv "Source <YOUR_VENV_NAME>/bin/activate" or "workon <YOUR_VENV_NAME>"

* Install all the modules "pip install -r requirements.txt"

* All the credentils from in configurations/settings.py are saved in .env file. Please assign your own credentials to all variables provided in this repo file: ".env-secrets"  

* Create the database:
  * "python manage.py makemigrations"
  * "python manage.py migrate"

* Create an admin "python manage.py createsuperuser"

* Set up the local server: "python manage.py runserver"

* To login as an admin go to 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/stolen-goods-admin/'

# 7. Relational Database
Everytime we add or change the database, the django application will not be automatically connected. This is why we always need to re-run:
* "python manage.py makemigrations"

* "python manage.py migrate"

* "python manage.py createsuperuser"

# 7a. Setup
For the database setup, I assumed that you atleast have Postgres.app, if not [Download here](https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html)

* Activate your postgres service on postgres app or run "pg_start"

* Open DataGrip or your prefered IDE for database
* ## SQLite3 Setup:
  * Upload the .sqlite3 file "New => Data Source => SQLite3 => File"

  * Click "Test connection" and then "ok"

## Django also provides 2 pre-made classes for using SQLite3 which create 2 relational database tables:
* (ORM) Class SQLiteSequence <=> (Relational Database Table) sqlite_sequence

* (ORM) Class SQLiteMaster <=> (Relational Database Table) sqlite_master

## For upgrading this project's admin login security, this project uses a plugin called "django-admin-honeypot" that creates 1 relational database table:
* (ORM) Class AdminHoneypotLoginAttempt <=> (Relational Database Table) admin_honeypot_login_attempt

## Relationships:

# 7c. Database Queries used in this Project
## SQL Query 1:
  * CREATE TABLE table_name(table_column);
  
  * Query with python:
    * Create a python class in your_app_name/models.py:
      * class TableName(models.Model)

    * On the terminal run:
      * python manage.py makemigrations

      * python manage.py migrate
#

## SQL Query 2:
  * INSERT INTO accounts_customuser(email, username, password) VALUES("admin@stolengoods.wtf", "admin", "admin123");
  
  * Query with python:
    * custom_user = CustomUser.objects.create_user(email="admin@stolengoods.wtf", username="admin", pasword="admin123")
#

## SQL Query 3:
* INSERT INTO accounts_user_profile(id, first_name, last_name, user_id) VALUES(1, "nino", "lindenberg", 1);

* Query with python:  
  * current_user = request.user

  * profile = UserProfile()

  * profile.user_id = user.id

  * profile.save()
#

## SQL Query 4:
* SELECT * FROM table_name;

* Query with python:
  * products = Product.objects.all()
#

## SQL Query 5:
  * SELECT * FROM carts_cartitem INNER JOIN ON carts_cartitem.acounts_customuser_id = accounts_customuser.id;

  * Query with python:
    * current_user = request.user

    * cart_items_from_current_user = CartItem.objects.filter(user=current_user)
#

## SQL Query 6:
* SELECT * FROM product_product WHERE is_availabel='True' ORDER BY id;

* Query with python:
  * products = Product.objects.all().filter(is_available=True).order_by('id')
#

## SQL Query 7:
  * SELECT username FROM accounts_customuser WHERE username = auth_user.username;
  * UPDATE accounts_customuser SET password = "new password";

  * Query with python:
    * user = User.objects.get(username__exact=request.user.username)

    * user.set_password("new_password")

    * user.save()

# 7d. Index-ing in Django:
* Index is declared inside the meta class in each python class in models.py

* Syntax: ordering = ("your index",)

* Adding a "-" before the "your index" inside the tupple will access the row from the database table with that particular index (column) in the descending order

# 8. CI / CD
The CI/CD implemented in this project is using the GitHub Actions which is written in YAML syntax in a .yaml or .yml file and saved in .github/workflows directory.

## Continuous Integration (CI):
CI is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors or contributions into a single software project.

* The main jobs in this CI:
  * 3 jobs in which each will be running on 3 different python versions (3.7, 3.8, 3.9)
  
  * Using docker vm container from GitHub to check the health of PostgreSQL used in this project
  
  * Linting with Flake8 to make sure that the code is written based on a good clean code convention
  
  * Testing with "Pytest-Cov" to make sure that the program will not break in production

## Continuous Deployment (CD):
CD is a strategy for software releases wherein any code commit that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released into the production environment, making changes that are visible to the software's users. 

* The job for the CD in this project is created to make sure that only codes which have passed the Pytest-Cov will be pushed to Heroku to be deployed into the production stage

# 9. Hosting
This project uses Heroku (PaaS: Platform as a Service) which is a cloud-based, scalable server solution that allows developers to easily manage the deployment of their web applications. The name "stolengoods.wtf" and a validated PositiveSSL certificate is bought and issued through NameCheap.

# 10. Paypal Integration
